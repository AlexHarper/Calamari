Calamari is the command-line tool invoked by Tentacle during a deployment. It knows how to extract and install NuGet packages, run the Deploy.ps1 etc. conventions, modify configuration files, and all the other things that happen during an deployment.

This repository is currently a work-in-progress as we migrate the tools and scripts from Tentacle 2.x.
